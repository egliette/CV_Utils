# Resource Profiling and FPS Tracking

**Kano** provides classes for monitoring system resource usage (CPU and RAM) and tracking frames per second (FPS). The following classes are included:

- **FPSCounter**: A class that tracks frames per second (FPS) for a given application.
- **ResourceProfiler**: A class that monitors system resource usage (CPU and RAM) at regular intervals and optionally logs the data to a CSV file.
- **FPSProfiler**: A subclass of `ResourceProfiler` that also tracks FPS and logs it along with CPU and RAM usage.
