# Real-time Fake Detection

**Kano** provides classes for simulating and visualizing object detection results, including smooth transitions between bounding boxes. The following classes are included:

- **`FakeDetect`**: Simulates smooth transitions between two bounding boxes over a specified duration, ideal for testing object detection systems.
- **`DetectGen`**: Manages and generates a sequence of fake detections with looping options like **NoLoop**, **Reversed**, and **Replay** for flexible simulation and testing.
